I'm the #1 princess in the world
And that's how you'll treat me, got it?

One: You must notice that I changed my hair
Two: Take a good look, all the way to my shoes
You following?
Three: For every one word I say, reply with three
Got it? Then do something about
My idle right hand!

It's not like it's selfish or anything
To want you to believe
From the bottom of your heart
That I'm adorable

I'm the #1 princess in the world
Notice me! Hey! Heeey!
Keeping me waiting is
Out of the question
Just who do you think I am?
Hmph, I think I could go for some dessert!
This very instant

Shortcake with a strawberry on top
Premium creamy egg pudding
Okay, okay, I'll try to contain myself…
Don't write me off as selfish
Because hey, I can make it on my own
You're gonna regret it later

No doubt! 'Cause you know I'm…

The #1 princess in the world
You'd better keep your eyes on me
Or I might not be here one day
Out of nowhere, you pull me from behind
"What are you… Huh?"
"Look out, you almost got run over!"
You say as you turn away

…Maybe it's you I should be looking out for
